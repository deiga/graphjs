# GraphJS

**GraphJS** is a simple Javascript library for manipulating undirected [graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_\(mathematics\)).

Your graphs may have self edges and weighted edges, but not multiedges or directed edges.

## Usage

    var g = new Graph();
    g.set('a', 'b', 3); # create (a, b) edge with weight 3
    g.get('b', 'a'); # returns 3

## Tests

GraphJS is packaged with [jqUnit](http://code.google.com/p/jqunit/) tests. To run the tests, load the `graphjs/test/test.html` page in your favorite browser.
